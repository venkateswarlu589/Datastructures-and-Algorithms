# Two-Pointers
Why use two-pointer
By reducing nested loops, the two-pointers strategy reduces time complexity.
The fundamental requirement for employing the two-pointers technique to solve a problem effectively is that each pointer travels independently in a single direction.
They can travel in opposite directions, but the direction should not change.
